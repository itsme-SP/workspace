# Embedded Systems Workspace 

This repository contains my practice projects and experiments in **Embedded Systems**, mainly using **STM32 (STM32F401RE Nucleo)** and **ESP32** boards.  
I am currently pursuing my 7th semester in ECE and building my skills in **Embedded C, RTOS, and low-level driver development**.

##  Contents

- **STM32 Projects**
  - GPIO driver (custom implementation for STM32F401RE)
  - LED blink and toggling
  - UART communication basics
  - Timer & delay functions
## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated
- Embedded C programming
- STM32 HAL & custom drivers
- ESP32 FreeRTOS programming
- Peripheral interfacing (GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, Timers)
- Git & GitHub for version control

##  Notes
These projects are part of my learning journey in embedded systems.  
I aim to continuously improve and document my work as I progress.
